A repository for understanding integrated and expected gradients, two methods
that are used to explain the output of deep neural networks.

Contributions: as the only author of this project, I did all of it! That includes
data gathering and developing the interactive visualizations, as well as the write up, the poster etc.

All of the images displayed in this repository are either from the ImageNet 2012 dataset (in the case of natural images), or from my own research. The same goes for the data/attribution maps.
